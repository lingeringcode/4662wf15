        <p>
          WRIT 4662W is an advanced level Writing Studies course that explores digital writing technologies and provides opportunities to assess writing situations and make appropriate decisions about digital form and production. Students learn the basic building blocks of writing in Internet environments (text, sound, images, video, interactivity) as well as the vocabularies, functionalities, and organizing structures of Web 2.0 environments, how these impact understanding and use of information, and how to produce these environments (i.e., multimedia internet documents) for interactivity and use. This course includes design projects and practice with apps, markup language, content management systems, video, and social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this class, you will learn some fundamental and some novel ways writing for Internet-based environments has modified professional and everyday literacy practices. You will learn and write semantically rich HTML and DITA markup. Putting such writing skills into action, you will:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Write <a href="#prose-posts">reading posts</a> in Markdown, publish them to the online "git" version control system, and use Github to coordinate <a href="#group-responses">group responses</a>;
          <li>
            Create a static website (HTML/CSS) that <a href="#historicizing-project">historicizes</a> a Web-based writing technology; and 
          <li>
            Architect and write a topic model (DITA) that will enable you to create <a href="#reusable-content-project">reusable, programmable content</a>.
        </ol>
        <p>
          These writing skills will provide you the opportunity to learn writing processes involved in developing web content in tandem with how such content is programmable and reusable, delivering diverse user experiences across numerous document and device types.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will frame our goals to learn such writing skills by reading research that will help us understand how written communication, its production and interpretation, is a fusion of old and new media. And, how such writing practices &ndash; the cultural knowledge, tech, and skills binding a literate task &ndash; is always historically-shaped and socially-packaged.
        </p>

        <h3>&raquo; Defining Writing</h3>
          <p>
            Perhaps, over the years, as you have taken more courses and written more types of documents in different contexts and domains, you have realized that writing for different stakeholders and audiences influences the types of writing you produce. And, even the process by which it is accomplished.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this class, we take that initial insight and dig deeper into it. I ask you to consider the overarching claim that there is no such thing as big "W" Writing. Rather, writing can be best understood as linked to material technologies and socially organized, recurrent, goal-directed practices. Then, as individuals, who come from diverse backgrounds, we can begin to better identify, learn, and navigate such writing practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, writing and writing technologies reconfigure the types of writing made possible. Accordingly, we are going to test and explore this claim by writing with fundamental and more novel web-based technologies, markup languages, and web semantics (see Fig. 1).
          </p>

                      There is no capital 'W' writing, because writing is intertwined with culture. Writing is a social-historical practice that individual's learn with particular uses of cultural sign systems. We'll take some time to understand what this means and how it should help you (re)think writing.

                      Technical communication is leading the way with how text is becoming even more malleable in networked, digital environments. Audiences often only need snippets of information related to your larger topic, so you will be introduced to a variety of ways content is being made to conform to particular audience needs and situations. And, ultimately, how this changes <em>how</em> you write about your topic.

        <h3>&raquo; Course Time Commitment</h3>
          <p>
            This is a 4-credit, senior-level, writing-intensive course with both undergraduate and masters-level students in it. Such a course requires approximately 12 hours of work per week. You should expect consistent, steady writing and reading work every week throughout the semester.

          <p>
            Part of being a writing and communication professional is constantly learning, growing, and developing new skills. To help you retain, synthesize, and integrate all of the conceptual and skill-building work, you will respond to a series of questions or a provided prompt about the readings for the week. These writings will guarantee a thorough and meaningful reading, priming our class time together. Overall, these writings will help us build a vocabulary for how to talk about writing in relationship to technology.
          </p>

          <h4>Rubric for conceptual reading responses</h4>
            <p>
              These responses are graded. I assess them by the quality and thoughtfulness of your responses. I will look for the following properties in your written responses:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Response pushed to Github by the Sunday before the next class time. This ensures your reading peers have ample time to read, review, and respond to your post.

                Demonstrates understanding of the main arguments, claims, and important concepts.
              <li>

          <h4>Reading groups &amp; graduate-student boosters</h4>
            <p>
              For each response week, I will create reading groups to facilitate peer commentary of the responses on Github. For each group, I will appoint a graduate student as the group leader. In such a role, the grad student leaders will be responsible for "boosting" the response discussions by drawing connections and asking questions of their peers. This, of course, does not absolve undergraduates from doing such work, but the graduate students will also delegate tasks to their group members to synthesize and prepare a group synopsis and discussion for the entire class.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will use Github's comment feature on a particular files version history to conduct this process. Within the responses folder, I will create weekly folders, which will also contain group folders. You will be responsible for pushing to your designated group folder for the week, so you peers can easily find your response.

            A critical element to understanding any literacy technology is to understand how even the newest digital media is intertwined with older media and the cussedness of human (in)decision (See Fig. 2). In this writing project, I am asking you to <em>historicize</em> a <em>soft</em> Web technology and the complexity of human decision-making driving its development. To help define the shape of this assignment, let me explain what I mean by <em>historicizing</em> and <em>soft</em>.

            <span class="underline-text"><span class="first-letter-p">H</span>istoricizing</span>, according to Writing Studies researcher, Christina Haas (1996), is <q>"the reciprocal process of placing computer literacy technologies into historical contexts and, in turn, using those historical contexts to more fully understand today's technologies"</q> (p. 205). As Haas notes, this process is complicated, as is it a complicating process. By conducting this research process, you will need to address 1) the political and rhetorical movements motivating a soft web technologies development, and 2) how this particular technology is shaped by print media.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="underline-text"><span class="first-letter-p">S</span>oft</span> technology, in the context of this assignment, is an HTML-minded element with a standards body making decisions about its development. Examples include HTML and CSS elements, as well as their respective attributes and properties. If you're interested in visual modalities and their links with written modes, you can historicize soft technologies such as image file formats (.gif, .jpeg, .png), video codecs (FFMPEG, H.264/MPEG-4, WebM), or HTML elements like <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>. Or, you could historicize a particular newer design technology, such as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">flexbox</a>, tracing its cultural history and the implications of its use currently. Most importantly, historicizing a soft technology must be bounded by your desire to understand its link to print media and learning how to incorporate it into your web-based writing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, your task is to research, analyze, and write in modalities akin to the soft-tech being examined. You will have until week 8 of the semester (10/27) to create a protoype website about this particular technology, discussing its links with print media and the "many 'voices'" (Haas, 1996, p. 165) driving its development. I say "prototype," because you must revise this project within 1 month after its first due date.

        <h3 id="reusable-content-project">&raquo; Reusable content: Writing with DITA <small>(40% of total grade)</small></h3>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            This final project builds on multiple elements from your historicizing project. Previously, you learned how to write semantically-rich, static websites&mdash;websites that critically engaged in the complex of human-tool relations about the development of a particular web technology. You also researched into a particular writing practice surrounding a particular web-based technology. In this project, you will write with DITA markup to architect a help-focused, topic model that structures 3 particular writing tasks in relationship to your technology. Such a process will serve as a primer to writing reusable content with the DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) markup language.
          </p>
          <figure class="figure-inline">

          </figure>
          <p>
            Usually, when tasked to write, we often ground our ideas about how to write something in tandem with its material form and configuration. For example, a technical communicator writes user documentation for a coffee pot as, perhaps, a pocket guide, website, and/or a user manual. These different material configurations call for different writing decisions, practices, and even division of labor. Writing with DITA alters this process, and this final project is meant to introduce you to how it is indeed a similar but distinct form of digital written communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though DITA is another form of markup, akin to HTML, the writing process in DITA will go differently than when you wrote your static website. Writing with DITA means that you will develop and write content into modular, topic-based information units that can become numerous types of documents. In each modular unit, you describe a single concept, task, or reference item. Think of it like you are writing little Ikea-like content pieces that you can integrate into multiple types of "furniture." Accordingly, you must identify 3 particular (writing) tasks linked to your historicized technology, creating a mini-topic model.
          </p>

          <h4>Deliverables</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                (Mini) Topic model of the writing practice linked to your HTML-minded technology. The model should be architected in keeping with 3 common (writing) tasks linked to your technology.
              <li>
                Two to 3 page (single-spaced, TNR, 12-pt font) memo accompanying your topic model that includes the following: 1) documents what is included, and 2) rationalizes the decisions behind its information architecture.

            <p>
              This project is in keeping with presentation/workshop situations common to professional and academic conferences. Each graduate student must research and lead an approximately 25-minute teaching session on a particular writing practice or technology pertinent to the class for that week. In short, based on what we are covering for that week, consider what technology or best practice your peers will need and want to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="underline-text">You must provide me with at least 2 weeks notice</span>, so we can decide what might work best for everyone. Also, after choosing your week and talking to me, you can poll your peers about what tech / practice is most desirable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The session must include a:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Short history of the tech / practice (2-3 minutes),
              <li>Short, high-level description about the purpose and functional properties of the tech / practice (5 minutes),
              <li>Tutorial-workshop component to help your colleagues learn how and when to use this tech / practice (15-18 minutes), and
              <li>"Best practices" and resources handout for everyone.

                    <li>Summarize each reading; each as in each chapter in Duckett and Pilgrim's chapter. Perhaps, with Pilgrim's chapter, focus on a particularly useful-to-you set of content to write about.
                    <li>Literally hand-code, i.e., write out with your hands, paper, &amp; pencil, a webpage with at least the following elements:
                      <ul>
                        <li>the MIME type declaration
                        <li>In the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, at least 3 <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, and 2 resource <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags
                        <li>In the body, use an HTML5 structure, using <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements. Also, the following: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>.
                        <li>Choose 2 more HTML elements.
                        <li>For each element, provide proper attributes and write content that is "meta," describing its purpose.
                      </ul>
                    <li>Now, scan your hand-coded site as a <code>&lt;jpg&gt;</code>, or series of <code>&lt;jpg&gt;</code>'s and "post" it in a dedicated section at the end of your post for the week in your teams' designated folder.

                      <li>
                        Be sure to set up your web-writing environment on your laptop, using Duckett's instructions for both Mac and PC in chapter 1.

                        Also, set up git on your computer. You will need to use it to upload images to your designated team folder. I suggest that you first test and learn how to do it in your own test repo. Then, push your scanned images to your designated team image folder.

                      Write some basic CSS for your bio site that you wrote during last week's class meeting in 2 ways: 1) without Bootstrap or Pure.css, 2) with Bootstrap or Pure.css (choose one). Take notes as you develop the two, noting differences, difficulties, insights into writing CSS. For example, you could catalog what problems you encountered and how you overcame such problems.
                    <li>
                      Create 1 new repo for each bio website, using the following naming scheme for the root folder:
                      <ol>
                        <li>bio-no-framework
                        <li>bio-framework-purecss or bio-framework-bootstrap
                      </ol>
                    <li>
                      Name your .html file "index.html"
                    <li>
                      Write a post on Prose.io, documenting insights gleaned from this assignment, and save it to your team folder in wk4. I expect you to apply the conceptual framework surrounding mediation and a <em>practice account of writing</em> to your understanding of writing HTML and CSS.

                      Find 2-3 credible sources on some web technology/writing practice. The goal is for you to identify a possible interest to pursue for the historicizing project. One of the sources should be a W3C, WHATWG, or CSSWG specification. The other, perhaps, from a person who serves on the body.

                          <span class="underline-text">Summary of Haas (1996), "Social dynamics, or scientific truth, or sheer human cussedness: Design decisions in the evolution of a user interface"</span>: Your summary should demonstrate your current understanding of Haas' broader argument about technology development <em>and</em> how her Vygotskian concept of mediational means helps her later analyze the design of the scroll bar and menu in Andrew. Be sure to capture these structural parts of her argument, but also dig into some details of interest to the goals of the historicizing project.
                        <li>
                          <span class="underline-text">HTML5</span>: Discuss the implications for using HTML5 on older browsers, which Duckett and Pilgrim both address. This section can be shorter, but be sure to understand some of the things going on in the &lt;<code>head</code>&gt; element of the HTML5 boilerplate. (Hint: See the <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/5.2.0/dist/doc/html.md" target="_blank">docs</a>).
                        <li>
                          <span class="underline-text">Historicizing Pitch</span>: Using your 2-3 sources, pitch 2-3 web technologies that you are considering to historicize. Each of them must be connected to a particular writing and design practice. Address the following questions in subsections: What practices are linked to this technology: tools, community knowledge and values, &amp; skills? What competing issues or trends are you interested in investigating in more detail? Why? I hope that Haas' chapter will be able to help you consider how the HTML-minded technologies of your choosing may or may not be viable historicizing projects.

This matrix will help trace connections between past and present.

                        Tip: You can also draw makeshift matrices in your notebooks, or simply use the box-comparisons to demarcate note-taking sections.

                      Develop content for the blocks by first creating a content tree (see Duckett, chp. 18). To do so:

                        <li>
                          Use paper to plot out a structure.

                      The Youtube video playlist (see below).

At the very least, I suggest reading through the task topics as you read Bellamy <em>et al</em>. &amp; the video playlist on task topics.
                    <li>
                      You have been organized into new teams; see the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Writing-with-Digital-Technologies-f15/teams" target="_blank">roster on our class page on Github</a>. Conduct a code-review of your partners' <a href="http://writing-with-digital-technologies-f15.github.io/historicizing/" target="_blank">historicizing projects</a>. Follow these guidelines, when conducting the review on the project as a whole:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          In your own words, how would you characterize the main argument or goal of the historicizing project?
                        <li>
                          Comment on what elements support this aim and others that stray from it.
                        <li>
                          Using Duckett (pp. 465 - 474) as your rubric, provide suggestions and commentary on the design: visual hierarchy, grouping and similarity, and designed navigation.
                        <li>
                          Note any areas in the project where you wanted to hear more from your peer, or the topic needs or deserves more attention. Reviewers be generous about sharing your questions and ideas for further development within, of course, the aims of the project.
                        <li>
                          Conduct a code review, using the inline comment functions on Github for any other matters.
                      </ul>
                      Note: These criteria should help you take notes as you read through the project. Write up your response as a comment to provide on the index.html document. Provide any other comments in situ using the inline comments feature.
                  </ul>

                      After you and your team have read the chapters and watched the videos, conduct a task analysis (Bellamy <em>et al</em>., pp. 19-20) of posting a Prose.io post in this course. Replace the "business goal" with "student's goal."
                    <li>
                      Publish your teams' task analysis as a response post on Github with one of your team members' account.
                    <li>
                      As noted in the Readings section, publish your peer review to your partners' overall comments on the index.html file.
                    <li>
                      Test out the DITA-OT with the example topic models within the <a href="https://github.com/Writing-with-Digital-Technologies-f15/DITA" target="">DITA</a> repo. Take notes about difficulties, insights, interests, questions, etc. Bring your notes to class. The more you test the OT out now, the more prepared you will be when you start writing DITA markup.

                        <li>
                          Push your generated output to your personal DITA folder with your notes in a README.md file.

                    All of your writings are due by class-time.

                    <li>
                      Complete your practice <code>&lt;task&gt;</code> topic(s) for the prose.io response posts. Now, incorporate and push it to your practice repo with both PDF and HTML5 outputs.
                    <li>
                      After completing the readings for the week, write at least one <code>&lt;concept&gt;</code> and one <code>&lt;reference&gt;</code> topic. Then, add those topics into your <code>.ditamap</code> file. Test the new model into a new output directory as both HTML5 and PDF. (Reminder: You can specify the name of the output folder with the OT command.)
                    <li>
                      Write a response post that includes the following topics:
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          Discuss what you learned about writing with DITA: any boundaries that you encountered and overcame, new questions that emerged, etc.
                        <li>
                          Based on the feedback that you received on your historicizing project, write out a revision timeline with concrete tasks and weekly deadlines. 
                      </ol>
                    <li>
                      Be sure to complete some tasks related to revising your historicizing project.

                    Remember to test, test, test your DITA topic models incremenetally, so you do not have to deal with numerous errors, when generating output.

                  <p>
                    Also, keep the DITA v1.2 spec open and available when writing. You won't always remember all of your semantically available means are, or how such elements relate to one another.

        <h3>&raquo; University Writing Intensive Requirement</h3>
          <p>
            The writing in this advanced-level course takes up fundamental and novel markup languages to help students understand the complexity of how texts operate on the Web. As a result, much of the writing will be conducted in tools estranged from typical academic publishing editors, such as word processors with page counts. Despite these differences in document production, this course requires students to produce a significant amount of text that fulfills UMN's following WI criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Writing is comprehensively integrated into the course
            </li>
            <li>
              The writing in the course must be tied to the course objectives and course outcomes. The syllabus must reflect the critical role that writing plays in the course. Writing assignments in a WI course may be designed as a means to achieving mastery of course content, as a means to enable students to develop professional output, or as a balance between the two.
            </li>
            <li>
              Writing is a significant part of the course work
            </li>
            <li>
              Students must write at least 2,500 words or the equivalent of finished writing, in genres and modes of production appropriate for the course and discipline. The written products may be distributed over a variety of assignments or through a single major assignment; both are encouraged. Group-authored documents may be part of a WI course, but each student must meet the minimum word count.
            </li>
            <li>
              Writing is a significant part of the course grade 
            </li>
            <li>
              Writing must be a major component of the final course grade, with this relationship detailed explained in the syllabus.
            </li>
            <li>
              Writing is learned through revision
            </li>
            <li>
              Instructors should provide substantial feedback on writing assignments, and allow revision in response to that feedback. Continuous, focused feedback building systematically over the course of the class is encouraged, as is a variety of modes and purposes of feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              Writing is explained and practiced in the course
            </li>
            <li>
              Explicit writing instruction must be integral to the course, as part of the course content and as a significant, recurring activity. Through instruction, students should learn about writing, including its disciplinary structures and functions, and should practice writing in a variety of modes and settings appropriate to the discipline. The forms and types of writing instruction that will be used in the course should be explained in the syllabus or supporting teaching materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              Instructors should understand the practice of writing instruction
            </li>
            <li>
              Those responsible for teaching and assessing writing in a WI course should recognize the importance of writing instruction. If teaching assistants participate in teaching and assessing writing, they must be trained and supervised. If multiple faculty members are teaching a WI course, all must ensure that writing intensive requirements are met.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>&raquo; Attendance Policy</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike many courses at the University, WRIT 4662W is a small, discussion‐oriented class. Your attendance is required and will benefit your progress in the course. Please note the following policies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Missing the equivalent of one week or more of class with unexcused absences will result in a lower grade. Missing the equivalent of three weeks or more with unexcused absences will result in failing the course. In some cases, an excessive number of absences, even if they are excused, may result in a lower grade.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students are responsible for coming to class on time. Tardiness may be considered equivalent to unexcused absences. In addition, a student who is unable to function adequately in class (e.g., falling asleep or attending without appropriate materials or assignments) may be considered to have unexcused absences.
            </li>
            <li>
              Absences will be excused only with verification. Excused absences include illness as verified by a doctor's note, death in the immediate family, jury duty, military service, religious observances, and participation in officially scheduled university student organization events (e.g., inter‐collegiate athletics, ROTC, school sports events; see the <a href="http://www.cla.umn.edu/cgep/3.html">CLA policy</a>). Excused absences do not include vacations, transportation problems, or employment. In case of an excused absence, you must notify your instructor of your excuse preferably before you miss class, but no later than 24 hours after the absence.
            </li>
            <li>
              A student who is absent for any reason is responsible for all material and activities missed in class. Students must check with the instructor to find out was missed.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>&raquo; Academic honesty &amp; integrity</h3>
          <p>
            When you use the citable work of someone else, document your source. If you have questions about plagiarism as you complete your work, please ask me. I reserve the right to fail a student in the course for plagiarism, i.e., using other people's work without proper documentation and citation. See the <a href="http://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/policies/Student_Conduct_Code.pdf" target="_blank" title="UMN Student Conduct Code">UMN Student Conduct Code</a> for more information.
          </p>
          <p>
            For resources on how to appropriately use and cite sources, and to avoid plagiarism, see UMN's "<a href="http://writing.umn.edu/sws/quickhelp/sources.html">Quick Help</a>."
          </p>

        <h3>&raquo; Sexual Harassment</h3>
          <p>
            "Sexual harassment" means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and/or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work or academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or academic environment in any University activity or program. Such behavior is not acceptable in the University setting. For additional information, please consult <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/regents/policies/humanresources/SexHarassment.html">Board of Regents Policy</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Equity, diversity, equal opportunity, &amp; affirmative action</h3>
          <p>
            The University will provide equal access to and opportunity in its programs and facilities, without regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, gender, age, marital status, disability, public assistance status, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. For more information, please consult <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/regents/policies/administrative/Equity_Diversity_EO_AA.html">Board of Regents Policy</a>.
          </p>
        
        <h3>&raquo; Students with Disabilities</h3>
          <p>
            The University is committed to providing quality education to all students regardless of ability. Determining appropriate disability accommodations is a collaborative process. You as a student must register with Disability Services and provide documentation of your disability. The course instructor must provide information regarding a course's content, methods, and essential components. The combination of this information will be used by Disability Services to determine appropriate accommodations for a particular student in a particular course. For more information, please reference <a href="http://ds.umn.edu/information-for-students.html">Disability Services</a>.
          </p>

        <h3>&raquo; Mental health services</h3>
          <p>
            As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and may reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.umn.edu">Student Mental Health Website</a>.
          </p>
          
        <h3>&raquo; Academic freedom and responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            Academic freedom is a cornerstone of the University. Within the scope and content of the course as defined by the instructor, it includes the freedom to discuss relevant matters in the classroom. Along with this freedom comes responsibility. Students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for truth. Students are free to take reasoned exception to the views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reports of concerns about academic freedom are taken seriously, and there are individuals and offices available for help. Contact the instructor, the Department Chair, your adviser, the associate dean of the college, or the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs in the Office of the Provost.
          </p>
